    - Steam
    - Epic Games Launcher

    - Will add more...
    - Emulator files
      - Only those with direct link at [Emulation Wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Emulator_files); distributed by the company, such as [PS3 firmware](https://www.playstation.com/es-es/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/); or with FOSS alternative.
      - Don't doubt that I'll modify this in case of ninjas.
 - Tools
    - [Steam ROM Manager](https://github.com/SteamGridDB/steam-rom-manager)
    - [Playnite](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/)
      - Steam Big Picture is better with Steam Input, but less customizable.  
 - Extra
    - Folder Structure
    - Adding a library to Windows (same as Doocuments / Images / Videos)
    - Settings for apps
    - Settings for emulators
      - Defaults are defaults for a reason, might do presets for high-end + resolutions
      - Controller profiles
    - Sym-links to centralize certain folders
      - Probably not
    - Program winget updates
      - Only if silent, and/or optional  
      - WingetUI

### Used tools
- Powershell scripts
- winget
  - Windows Package repository is YES/10

 ## Might do

- [EmuDeck](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck) if/when they release for Windows  
  - Is very possible that EmuDeck on its own makes all of this unnecessary.
